# Ultra-Simplified JSON for OneAgent - Before vs After

## The Original Complex rqBody (BEFORE)
```json
{
  "journeyId": "journey_1760965525450",
  "customerId": "customer_1760965525450",

  "domain": "www.next.co.uk",
  "industryType": "Retail",
  "stepName": "ProductSelection",
  "stepIndex": 2,
  "totalSteps": 6,
  "stepDescription": "Customer selects multiple products and adds them to cart",
  "stepCategory": "Selection",
  "estimatedDuration": 8,
  "businessRationale": "Selecting 2â€“3 items typically takes under 10 minutes once browsing is complete",
  "substeps": [

    },
    {
      "substepName": "Select size and add to cart",

    }
  ],
  "estimatedDurationMs": 480000,
  "subSteps": [],
  "hasError": false,
  "additionalFields": {
    "deviceType": "mobile",
    "browser": "Chrome",
    "location": "Manchester, UK",
    "entryChannel": "organic",
    "customerIntent": "purchase",
    "loyaltyStatus": "new",

    "conversionProbability": 0.75,
    "personalizationTags": ["shopping", "products"],

      "campaignSource": "organic",
      "customerSegment": "consumer", 
      "businessValue": 1500
    }
  }
}
```

**DQL Problem**: Requires complex JSON parsing like:
```sql
SELECT JSON_VALUE(requestBody, "$.additionalFields.deviceType"),
       JSON_VALUE(requestBody, "$.customerProfile.userId"),
       JSON_VALUE(requestBody, "$.traceMetadata.businessContext.campaignSource")
FROM useraction 
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"
```

## The New Ultra-Simplified rqBody (AFTER)

  // FLATTENED additionalFields - NO nested object!

  "customer_demographic": "consumers aged 18-65", 
  "customer_painPoints": "high prices, limited selection",

  "substep_0_duration": 3,
  "substep_1_name": "Select size and add to cart",
  "substep_1_duration": 5
}
```

**DQL Solution**: Dead simple queries!
```sql
-- Get device types
SELECT additional_deviceType 
FROM useraction 
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Get customer info  
SELECT customer_userId, customer_email
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Get business context
SELECT business_campaignSource, business_customerSegment
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Get specific product costs
SELECT additional_ProductCost_0, additional_ProductCost_1, additional_ProductCost_2
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Get substep details
SELECT substep_0_name, substep_0_duration, substep_1_name, substep_1_duration
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"
```

## Summary

âœ… **ELIMINATED** all nested JSON objects from the rqBody  
âœ… **FLATTENED** everything to simple top-level fields  
âœ… **SIMPLIFIED** DQL queries - no JSON parsing needed  
âœ… **PRESERVED** array data with both list and indexed access  
âœ… **CLEAR** naming conventions with intuitive prefixes  

**Result**: This is as simple as JSON can get while preserving all the data! ðŸŽ‰
