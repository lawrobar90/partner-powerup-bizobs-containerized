# Flattened Fields Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Instead of complex nested JSON structures in OneAgent-captured request bodies, we now have simple, flat fields that are easy to query with DQL.

## Before (Complex Nested Structure)
```json
{
  "additionalFields": {
    "ProductCost": [100, 200, 300],
    "PaymentMethod": "Credit Card"
  },
  "customerProfile": {
    "userId": "test123",
    "tier": "gold"
  },
  "traceMetadata": {
    "source": "web",
    "businessContext": {
      "department": "sales",
      "region": "US"
    }
  }
}
```

**DQL Query Challenge**: Would require complex JSON parsing:
```sql
SELECT JSON_VALUE(requestBody, "$.additionalFields.PaymentMethod") 
FROM useraction 
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"
```

## After (Flattened Structure)
OneAgent now captures both the original structure AND flattened fields:

```json
{
  "additionalFields": {...},  // Original structure preserved
  "customerProfile": {...},   // Original structure preserved
  "traceMetadata": {...},     // Original structure preserved
  
  // NEW: Flattened fields for easy DQL access
  "additional_ProductCost": "100, 200, 300",
  "additional_ProductCost_0": 100,
  "additional_ProductCost_1": 200,
  "additional_ProductCost_2": 300,
  "additional_PaymentMethod": "Credit Card",
  "customer_userId": "test123",
  "customer_tier": "gold", 
  "customer_region": "US-East",
  "trace_source": "web",
  "business_department": "sales",
  "business_region": "US"
}
```

**Simple DQL Queries** now possible:
```sql
-- Get payment methods
SELECT additional_PaymentMethod 
FROM useraction 
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Get customer tiers
SELECT customer_tier, customer_userId
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Get business context
SELECT business_department, business_region
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"

-- Array access made simple
SELECT additional_ProductCost_0, additional_ProductCost_1, additional_ProductCost_2
FROM useraction
WHERE application = "BizObs-CustomerJourney"
```

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `/home/ec2-user/partner-powerup-bizobs/services/dynamic-step-service.cjs`

### Flattening Logic
1. **additionalFields** â†’ `additional_*` prefix
2. **customerProfile** â†’ `customer_*` prefix  
3. **traceMetadata.businessContext** â†’ `business_*` prefix
4. **traceMetadata** (other fields) â†’ `trace_*` prefix
5. **Arrays** â†’ Both comma-separated string AND indexed access:
   - `additional_ProductCost: "100, 200, 300"`
   - `additional_ProductCost_0: 100`
   - `additional_ProductCost_1: 200`
   - `additional_ProductCost_2: 300`

### Benefits
âœ… **No complex business event API calls needed** - OneAgent captures everything automatically  
âœ… **Simple DQL queries** without JSON parsing complexity  
âœ… **Backward compatibility** - original nested structure preserved  
âœ… **Array access** - both aggregated and indexed field access  
âœ… **Clear naming convention** with intuitive prefixes  

## Test Results
Direct service test confirmed flattened fields are working:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4119/process -d '{...}' 
# Returns response with both nested and flattened fields
```

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Flattened field structure implemented
2. âœ… OneAgent captures simplified request body  
3. ðŸŽ¯ Ready for DQL querying in Dynatrace UI
4. ðŸ“Š Monitor business observability with simple field access

---
**Result**: DQL queries are now dramatically simpler for business observability analysis!
